\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The investigation of an interplay between geometry and topology of the order parameter has become one of the key research fields in the modern soft and solid state physics, as it provides insight on the modification of material responses by geometrical tailoring. This result provides means both for fundamental study and technological applications: the presence of curvature in a generic electronic system leads to the appearance of scalar and vector geometric potentials, that introduce anisotropic and chiral responses to the system, respectively, and this in turn allows to fabricate novel logical and signal elements, that will meet growing technological demands for the high-density energy efficient electronics. For instance, novel fundamental responses were observed in thin layers of superconductors~\cite{Tempere09,Ying17}, superfluids~\cite{Kuratsuji12}, nematic liquid crystals~\cite{Lopez-Leon11}, cell membranes~\cite{McMahon05}, semiconductors~\cite{Gentile15,Ortix15} and magnetism~\cite{Streubel16}.
