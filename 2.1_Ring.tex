\subsection{Magnetic nanorings} \label{subsec:Nanorings}

The ring geometry is a prototypical example of a highly-symmetrical curved system with non-trivial topology, that was investigated intensively both experimentally~\cite{Klaui01,Klaui03a,Klaui05a} and theoretically~\cite{Kravchuk09,Kravchuk11} due to the potential applications in magnetic storage media. To control the recording element it is necessary to have at least two different equilibrium magnetization states and well defined switching mechanism between them. In the case of magnetic nanorings made from soft magnetic materials the main equilibrium state is a \textit{vortex state} in which the magnetic flux is closed in the element.
